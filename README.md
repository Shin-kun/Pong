# Pong

The Game is called Pong. 
This game has two players playing against each other. Like the real life Pingpong, the goal is to score one against your opponent.

RED: PLAYER 1
      USE LEFT ARROW KEY for LEFT TURN
      USE RIGHT ARROW KEY for RIGHT TURN

BLUE: PLAYER 2
      USE A for LEFT TURN
      USE D for RIGHT TURN
      
There us a chance that a lightining would appear in screen. If the ball collides with it, then it would speed up.

THAT IS ALL! THANK YOU!
